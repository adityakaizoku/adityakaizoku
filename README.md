I'm Yashwanth, saying hi from India! Just like a friendly neighbor, I'm here to share a bit about me.

🔭 I'm into AI and tech stuff, kinda like digging into the cool brains of computers. Right now, I'm hanging out in the world of Artificial Intelligence, learning and tinkering with it.

🌱 You know what's exciting? The tech world keeps changing like the weather, and I find it super interesting. I'm also into making stuff look nice on screens, that's UI/UX design.

🎧 Oh, and guess what's playing? "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee. The beats keep me company while I'm on this tech journey.

🤝 Let's connect on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/yashwanthkosuri) and chat about AI, tech, or anything else that's cool!

Thanks for stopping by, neighbor! 😄
